    <h2><strong> <em>About Me</em> </strong></h2>
    <p> Hello, I am Janani Ngii, and a beginner software developer. <br> I am currently conversant with the following languages: <br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am working on learning more languages in <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School.</a></p>
    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
    <h4><em>Education</em></h4>
    <p>I have a degree in <strong>Pharmaceutical Technology with IT</strong> from <em><a href="https://www.maseno.ac.ke/">Maseno university</a></em>.<br> I have since graduation worked in the pharma industry until a year ago when I chose to be a freelancer.<br> I now work as a virtual assistant and ocassionally as a freelance research assistant.</p>
    <h5><em>Why Programming?</em></h5>
    <p>I am interested in becoming a computer programmer because I like using computers.<br> I have been interested in computers since I was about two years old. <br> I am currently taking a programming class in <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"></a> and it has been so mind opening.<br> I think I will be able to design helpful or entertaining programs that people will want to buy in the end. <br>One more reason of taking this programming course is the improvement of my problem solving skills.</p>
