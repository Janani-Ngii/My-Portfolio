    <h5><stronger>Why Programming?</stronger></h5>
    <p>I am interested in becoming a computer programmer because I like using computers.<br> I have been interested in computers since I was about two years old. <br> I am currently taking a programming class in <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"></a> and it has been so mind opening.<br> I think I will be able to design helpful or entertaining programs that people will want to buy in the end. <br>One more reason of taking this programming course is the improvement of my problem solving skills.</p>
